### Smart Task Assignment

XephyrTime intelligently assigns tasks to your time entries:

1. **Explicit Task Names**: If you mention a task that exists in the project, it's assigned automatically
   - "Log development task to Project Alpha" ‚Üí Assigns "Development" task

2. **Smart Guessing**: Based on activity description, the AI guesses the most appropriate task
   - "Log meeting" ‚Üí Might assign "Daily Standup" or "Meetings" task
   - "Log bug fix" ‚Üí Might assign "Bug Fixes" or "Development" task
   - "Log research" ‚Üí Might assign "Research" or "Analysis" task

3. **Fallback**: If no appropriate task can be determined, the entry is created without a task

### Smart Project Assignment

XephyrTime can identify projects in multiple ways:

1. **Direct Project Name**: Use the exact project name
   - "Log 2 hours to Project Alpha" ‚Üí Assigns to "Project Alpha"

2. **Client-Based Matching**: Mention the client name when you don't know the exact project
   - "Log 2 hours to XWAT" ‚Üí If XWAT is a client, assigns to the project(s) under XWAT
   - "Log development time to ACME" ‚Üí Finds the project associated with ACME client

3. **Intelligent Context**: The AI considers both project and client information to make the best match

**Example Scenarios:**
- Your Clockify has: Client "XWAT" with Project "XMAP"
- Command: "Log 3 hours to XWAT" ‚Üí Automatically assigns to "XMAP" project
- Command: "Log meeting with ACME client" ‚Üí Finds project under ACME client

### Smart Defaults

The app includes intelligent defaults:

1. **Time Rounding**: All times are automatically rounded to 15-minute intervals (9:00, 9:15, 9:30, 9:45)
2. **Default Start Time**: Commands without specific times start from the current moment (rounded)
3. **Week Interpretation**: "This week" always means the week containing today, regardless of what day it is
4. **Default Duration**: If only duration is specified, it starts from current time
5. **Task Capitalization**: All task descriptions are automatically capitalized

### Submitting Entries

1. After parsing a command or importing from Teams, you'll see a preview of the time entries
2. Review the entries for accuracy, including assigned tasks and projects
3. Check for any warnings (overlapping times, missing projects)
4. Click "Submit to Clockify" to log the entries
5. Success notifications show detailed information: "‚úÖ Successfully logged 3 entries (5.5h total) across 2 projects"

## Command Examples

### Basic Time Logging (New Smart Defaults)
```
Log 3 hours development work
‚Üí Starts from current time, duration 3 hours, rounded to 15-min intervals
```

### Task Assignment Examples
```
Log standup to Project Alpha
‚Üí Automatically assigns to "Daily Standup" task if available

Log 2 hours bug fixing to Mobile App
‚Üí Assigns to "Bug Fixes" or "Development" task based on available options
```

### Client-Based Project Assignment Examples
```
Log 3 hours to XWAT
‚Üí If XWAT is a client, automatically assigns to the project under XWAT client

Log development meeting with ACME yesterday 2pm
‚Üí Finds the project associated with ACME client and assigns appropriate meeting task
```

### Teams Calendar Import Examples
```
Calendar event: "XMAP Planning Meeting" (2pm-3pm today)
‚Üí Imports as: Project "XMAP", Task "Meetings", Description "Planning Meeting"

Calendar event: "[ACME] Development Review" (10am-11am Monday)
‚Üí Imports as: Project "ACME", Task "Development", Description "Development Review"
```

### Current Week (Fixed Behavior)
```
Log meeting Monday this week
‚Üí Uses Monday of the week containing today (not next week)
```

### Specific Date and Time
```
Yesterday from 2pm to 4pm worked on bug fixes for the Mobile App project
```

### Recurring Entries
```
Log 30 minutes of standup every workday this week from 9:30 to 10:00 am
```

### Multiple Projects
```
Log 2 hours to Project A and 1 hour to Project B today starting at 9am
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API token" Error
- Check that you've entered the correct Clockify API token
- Ensure the token hasn't expired
- Try generating a new token in Clockify

### "OpenAI API key not configured" Error
- Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file
- Restart the development server after adding the key
- Alternatively, the app will prompt you to enter the key in the browser

### Teams Integration Issues
- **Sign-in fails**: Ensure your Azure app is properly configured with correct permissions
- **No calendar events**: Check that you have meetings in your calendar for the current week
- **Permission denied**: Make sure `User.Read` and `Calendars.Read` permissions are granted
- **Import fails**: Verify your Microsoft account has access to the calendar you want to import from

### Voice Recording Not Working
- Ensure your browser has microphone permissions
- Check that your microphone is working
- Try using a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- For Space key shortcut: make sure you're not focused on the text input

### Parsed Entries Look Wrong
- Be more specific in your commands
- Include project names, dates, and times clearly
- Try breaking complex commands into simpler ones

### Task Assignment Issues
- The app fetches available tasks from your Clockify projects
- Task assignment is based on intelligent matching - be descriptive about your activities
- If a task isn't assigned automatically, you can manually assign it in Clockify after submission

### "This Week" Showing Wrong Dates
- **Fixed**: The app now correctly interprets "this week" as the week containing today
- If today is Saturday and you say "Monday this week", it will use Monday of the current week
